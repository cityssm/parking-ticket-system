# Tips and Tricks

In no particular order, here are some tips to change transform you
from an average user to a power user.

## Web Application Basics

If you are moving from another application or environment to a web application,
you may not know these tricks that can greatly boost your productivity.

**Need to consult a licence plate record while working on a new ticket record?**<br />
Open the reference records in new tabs.  To open a link in a new tab,
hold the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while clicking on the link.
Alternatively, right-click the link, and choose "Open Link in New Tab".

**Need to print a report of what's on your screen right now?**<br />
Just print it!  Web applications make it easy to print any page you want.
The Parking Ticket System is no different, and makes every effort
to ensure that no matter which page you're on, when you print, you get a decent result.

## Parking Ticket System Tricks

**Is the side menu taking up too much space?**<br />
The side menu is a handy place for category specific links,
but can take up valuable space on smaller screens.
At the bottom of each side menu, there is a "Hide Side Menu" button
for collapsing the menu.  The space will be replaced by a `>>` button
that will bring the side menu back.

**If you're good with Microsoft Excel (or another spreadsheet application),
you can build pretty much any report you need.**<br />
Most tables used by the Parking Ticket System can be exported from the Reports page.
Look for the full table exports.
These exports also contain the keys necessary to link the tables together.
