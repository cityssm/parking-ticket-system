The Parking Ticket System is a web application project by the
[City of Sault Ste. Marie](https://saultstemarie.ca/)
to track parking tickets issued in our municipality.

Being an Ontario municipality, the system will interface with
Ontario's Ministry of Transportation to handle ownership lookups
and parking ticket convictions.

Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source environment
in hopes to pool developer resources from other Ontario municipalities
looking to move away from older, legacy systems.

## This project is incomplete and under active development

Significant, breaking changes are happening with each commit.
It is not ready to run in a live environment yet.
Completion is expected in early 2021.

It is being shared in it's current state to start the dialog among
other Ontario municipalities and present an option to those who may be looking
to refresh their own parking ticket management systems in the near future.
