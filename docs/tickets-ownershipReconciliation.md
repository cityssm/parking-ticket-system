# Ownership Reconciliation

![Parking Ticket Remarks and Statuses](images/tickets-ownershipReconciliation.png)

The Ownership Reconciliation page matches up ownership data retrieved from sources like
Ontario's Ministry of Transportation with parking ticket records.
Although retrieving records is quite specific to the country and province of the licence plate,
the reconciliation process is the same for all licence plates.

The **Lookup Errors** section displays problems that occurred while attempting to retrieve ownership information
for a particular licence plate.  Some reasons for errors include invalid licence plate numbers,
or inactive licence plates.
